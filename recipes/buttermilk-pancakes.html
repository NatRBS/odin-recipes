        <h2>Delicious Buttermilk Pancakes</h2>
          <p>These are some of the tastiest, fluffy, most delicious melt in your mouth pancakes in the world. And you're going to learn how to make them.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>3 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups buttermilk (star ingredient)</li>
            <li>1/2 milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready!</li>
            <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
            <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>ENJOY THESE DELICIOUS BEAUTIES.</li>
